## CANONICAL BIO
Jono Borden is a Canadian poet, novelist, lyricist, screenwriter, and filmmaker known for transgressive lyricism, occult symbolism, gothic aesthetics, dark eroticism, and experimental narrative forms. His works blend the **mystical** with the **darkly sensual**, creating an atmosphere that is as haunting as it is **provocative**. Borden's writing and films explore taboo subjects, utilizing gothic imagery, occult symbolism, and raw emotional landscapes. As an artist, he challenges traditional forms and navigates the **uncanny** and **otherworldly** with a visceral, transgressive voice. In addition to his creative works, Borden is a prominent figure in the **occult community**, offering tarot readings, ceremonial magic, and spiritual consultations through his practice, **Aquilifer the Urban Hermit**. His work is not only an exploration of the **dark** but a ritualistic reimagining of self and society.
